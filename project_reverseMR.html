                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>The idea for this visualization tool came from a personal need. My <a href="#">Master's project involved creating a novel variation of an epidemiological method called "Mendelian randomization"</a>.</p>
                    <h4>What is Mendelian randomization?</h4>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Essentially, Mendelian randomization works similar to a randomized controlled trial (often used in the context of testing whether a drug causes a disease to be cured). In a randomized controlled trial, individuals are <strong>randomly allocated</strong> to an experimental/drug vs. placebo group. With a sufficiently large sample size, randomization ensures both groups are equal on average in terms of all factors. Therefore, any differences over the course of a trial must be caused by the one factor we have explicitly altered - allocation of the drug vs. placebo. By the same principle, Mendelian randomization is mother nature's RCT. At birth, we are all <strong>randomly</strong> allocated different versions of genes (alleles) that correspond to higher/lower levels of certain behavioural traits (e.g. smoking), molecular traits (e.g. cholesterol), etc. For instance, if we find an allele that increases levels of testosterone leads to higher rates of heart disease, then it suggests testosterone causes heart disease. In contrast, by simply comparing groups of individuals with high and low testosterone, you cannot draw the same conclusion of <strong>causality</strong>. It's possible heart disease causes higher testosterone (reverse causation), or some unmeasured third variable is responsible for both higher testosterone and higher rates of heart disease (confounding). For more information, please read this <a href="#">review paper</a>.</p>

                    <p>Nevertheless, our variation of Mendelian randomization was called "reverse" Mendelian randomization. In traditional MR, we are often looking at molecular traits that cause disease. These are likely good targets for pharmaceutical companies to halt progression of a disease. However, there is also value in finding molecular traits that are themselves caused BY a disease. These would be good targets to diagnose and identify patients developing a disease. </p>
                    <p>To perform this analysis, you need two sets of associations... </p>
                    <p>Often the output of the datasets look like this...</p>
                    <p>However, there are several steps that need to be taken for all of the analyses...</p>

                      <li>There can be no outliers. This is checked by doing a leave-one-out analysis. But this can often take a long time, and it is helpful to see at-a-quick glance whether there are any SNPs having an abnormally large impact on the regression.</li>

                    <p class="mb-30">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
                      using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
                      sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                      specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                      and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
                    <blockquote>If you are still looking for that one person who will change your life, take a look in the mirror.</blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-30">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
                      Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                      1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
